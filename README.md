# Note App

### Live: https://candid-melomakarona-70adcb.netlify.app/

Project I am working on to test my React knowledge, I put into practice what I have learnt about props, state, useEffect, conditional rendering and some libraries as well!

It does Lazy State Initialization so React doesn't run notes state and therefore access to localStorage every time you make changes (type into a note).

-   Uses react-mde, showdown, split and nanoid
-   Saves notes in localStorage
-   Can edit and/or delete notes
-   When editing a note, it bumps said note to the top

## TODO:

-   Replace localStorage with Firebase
