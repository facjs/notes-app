# Note App

Project I am working on to test my React knowledge, I put into practice what I have learnt about props, state, useEffect, conditional rendering and some libraries as well!

-   Uses react-mde, showdown, split and nanoid
-   Saves notes in localStorage

## TODO:

-   Functionality to delete a note
-   Use the summary as the title for every note
-   Bump most recent note to the top
-   Replace localStorage with Firebase
